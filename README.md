## Performance Study of ACE Bufferpool Manager on Emulated SSDs
## Can Gokmen, Toby Ueno, Tommy Ho
1. Follow the steps to download the FEMU emulator at https://github.com/MoatLab/FEMU
2. When downloading the image files download u20s.qcow2 in the same directory as run-blackbox.sh and replace the contents of run-blackbox.sh with the version provided in our repo.
3. Afterwards you should be able to open the emulated ssd using ./run-blackbox.sh
4. After logging in using the FEMU credentials provided you should be able to download ACE-codebase from the following repo: https://github.com/BU-DiSC/ACE-codebase (you will need to import additional libraries to run experiments properly).
